# Project: NLP and ANNs
•	This project shows the use of ANNs in NLP works, involving text classification, and prediction. The ANN model was trained with real data and then evaluated with accuracy, loss, and validation.
# Project overview
•	Built and trained an ANN model using datasets including text. 
•	ANN architecture: an Embedding layer, dense layers with relu activation, final dense layer with sigmoid activation, evaluation with accuracy, loss, and prediction
# Results
•	Training accuracy: ~84%, 
•	validation accuracy: ~86%, 
•	model prediction: Clearly showed different classes., 
•	tools used: TensorBoard to visualize the training datasets.
# Project report
•	Full pdf code file attached Reports observed:
•	Preprocessing data, construct data pipeline, ANN model code (dense and embedding layers), training metrics, final prediction
# Data
•	Due to licensing restrictions, the dataset used in this project is not included. However, the codes and report work with similar NLP datasets.
